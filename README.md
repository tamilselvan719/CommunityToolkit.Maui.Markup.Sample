# CommunityToolkit.Maui.Markup.Sample
It's the same sample app from Maui.Markup github page, I add the Hotreload to BaseContentPage based on this post https://dev.to/davidortinau/c-ui-and-net-hot-reload-a-match-made-in-net-maui-243f, It's not a perfect solution but its better than restarting the app everytime you make small change in the UI.
